**Power Bi Sales, Consumer and Product Analytics Dashboard**

I designed and developed an interactive Power BI Sales Analytics Dashboard using three core datasets — Products, Consumers, 
and Sales — to analyze business performance and uncover actionable insights.

This dashboard highlights end-to-end BI capabilities including data cleaning, 
transformation, modeling, DAX calculations, and advanced storytelling visualizations.

Total Sales: 4.36M
Total Quantity Sold: 5586 units
Total Monetary Value: 265.41M
Total Inventory: 253K
Total Discount Offered: 33.46M

**Insights Identified:**

Top-selling products include Galaxy Buds Pro, Nomad Leather Case, Apple Watch Series 8, and iPad Pro 12.9”.
Monthly spending trend shows the highest spending in July with a steady decline towards November.
Regional analysis reveals the West region leads in spending (0.28M), followed by East and South.
Sales by payment method shows a near-even distribution, with Debit Card (28.16%) and Credit Card (25.01%) being most preferred.
Supplier stock levels show Supplier A provides the highest stock (71M).
Top 10 customers contribute significantly to overall sales, with standout customers driving major revenue.

**This project strengthened my skills in DAX, data modeling, interactive visuals, and business-focused storytelling.**
